# Introduction

This report is designed to help explore the results of an OpenMx analysis.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(polycor)
library(purrr)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(OpenMx))

opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
options(knitr.table.format = "html")

model_summary <- summary(model)
```

# `r model$name` Model Summary

This model was fit on `r format(model@output$timestamp, "%x at %I:%M%P")` using OpenMx v`r AdeFit@output$mxVersion`.


## Submodels

```{r submodel-description, results='asis'}
if (smN(model) == 1) {
  cat("This model included only a single submodel ", smNames(model), ".", sep = "")
} else {
  cat("This model included ", smN(model), " submodels.", sep = "")
}
```

### Submmary Statistics

The following table provides summary statistics for each of the included variables:

```{r submodel-summary-stats, results='asis'}
smSummaries(model) %>%
  kable() %>%
  collapse_rows(columns = 1) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "condensed")
```

### Covariance Matrices

Pairwise correlations were calculated among all variables comprising each submodel. Pearson product-moment correlations are used for numeric variables, polyserial correlations for numeric and ordinal variables, and polychoric correlations for ordinal variables.

```{r covar-calc}
sm.cors <- model %>% 
  smData() %>% 
  map(polycor::hetcor, use = "pairwise.complete")
```

```{r covar-tables, results='asis'}
sm.cors %>% 
  map("correlations") %>%
  iwalk(~ .x %>% 
          kable(caption = sprintf("%s correlations", .y), digits = 2) %>% 
          kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "condensed") %>% 
          cat
  )
```


## Free Parameters

This table shows a list of all the free parameters with their name, matrix element locators, parameter estimate and standard error, as well as lower and upper bounds if those were assigned. Note, `NA` is given for the name of elements that were not assigned a label. The columns **row** and **col** display the variables at the tail of the paths and the variables at the head of the paths, respectively.

```{r table-params}
kable(model_summary$parameters)
```

## Goodness of Fit Statistics

This tables includes the number of observed statistics, the number of estimated parameters, the degrees of freedom, minus twice the log-likelihood of the data, the number of observations, the chi-square and associated p-value and several information criteria.

```{r table-gof}
kable(table_gof(model_summary))
```
