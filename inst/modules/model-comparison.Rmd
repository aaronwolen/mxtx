<!-- requires list of MxModels assigned to .models -->

# Comparison: {{ .name }}

```{r {{ .label }}}-comparison-setup}
.base <- .models[[1]]
.comparisons <- .models[-1]
.n <- length(.comparisons)
```


The fit of `r ifelse(.n == 2, paste(.n, " models were "), paste(.n, " model was "))` compared to the **`r .base$name`** reference model. 
Raw fit statistics for `r .base$name` are presented in the first row, subsequent rows represent comparisons between `r .base$name` and models indicated in the *comparison* column. Model comparisons are made by subtracting the fit of the comparison model from the fit of `.base$name`.

```{r {{.label}}-comparison-table, results='asis'}
OpenMx::mxCompare(.base, .comparisons)[-1] %>%
  kable(digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "condensed")
```
